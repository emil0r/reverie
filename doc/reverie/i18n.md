# i18n

reverie users [Tower](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/tower) under the hood to handle i18n. The main difference is that reverie provides its own t function in order to bring locale handling under the direct management of reverie, with the ability to manually override if need be.

```clojure
(ns some-namespace
  (:require [reverie.i18n :as i18n :refer [t]]))

;; translation  
[:div
  [:h1 (t :foo/bar)]
  [:p (t :foo.bar/baz "argument just like with tower")]]

;; add translations
;; added translations don't remove already added translations
(i18n/add-i18n! {:dictionary {:no {:foo {:bar "bæz"}}}})

;; given a file named resources/i18n/de.edn
(i18n/add-i18n! "i18n/de.edn")

;; file i18n/de.edn could look like this, notice that :dictionary needs to be there
{:dictionary {:de {:foo {:bar "büz"}}}

;; manually override the locale

(i18n/with-locale :de
  (t :foo/bar))

```


## settings.edn

You can use settings.edn to set a dictionary, but given that i18n can become very big it's recommended to just setup :fallback-locale and :dev-mode? and instead use add-i18n! to load seperate dictionaries.

:middleware :i18n allows you to set the locale preferences for the site. They all take other one argument (keyword or string) or a vector of arguments. Locales are picked in the following order:

- enforce-locale: Use these locales no matter what. Middleware option :enforce-locale
- session-locale: Use locales in the session. Uses the session key :locale
- preferred-locale: Use these locales if enforce and session is empty. Middleware option :preferred-locale
- accept-lang-locales: Locales from the HTTP header Accept-Language
- fallback-locale: Use these locales as the fallback. Middleware option :fallback-locale. In the event fallback-locale is not specified :en is used instead.



```clojure
{;; other stuff
 :middleware {:i18n {:enforce-locale :sv
                     :preferred-locale [:en :de]
                     :fallback-locale [:en :sv :de]}}
 :i18n {:tconfig {:dictionary {:en {:foo {:bar "baz"}}
                               :sv {:foo {:bar "bäz"}}}
                  :dev-mode? true
                  :fallback-locale :en}}
}
 
```
